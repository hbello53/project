Week 7 JOURNAL 

Date
-	21-10-2019

Tasks
-	Research more about the part needed for the robotic lawn mower
-	Order the Arduino mega 2560
-	Making sure it is the right component 

Reflection
-	I finally ordered the Arduino mega and waiting arrival
-	I know I that I need 2 gear motors and H Bridge motor to drive the wheels
-	I realized the robotic lawn mower cannot run on Arduino UNO because I need to access more pins and more power

Issues:

Hardware:
1.	There are not enough resources online for inspiration for the lawn mower project
2.	The part that I sent to the technicians were not in stock 
3.	I underestimated the time for product to arrive 

Software:

Solutions

Hardware:
-	I have make sure they are in stock new time
-	Start the project from an autonomous RC car and feature as times go on

Software:
-	Use Arduino Mega 2560 as the brain of the lawn mower
