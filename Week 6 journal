Week 6 JOURNAL

Tasks
-	Finding out the component I am going to use for Robotic lawn mower
-	Going to the technician to order the parts 
-	Making sure it is the right component 

Reflection
-	I did manage to find some ideas for the mower uphill movement 
-	I think the lawn mower should be cheaper and cost effective 
-	Getting a v shape tire create more traction for the mower to go uphill
-	Making the lawn mower a four wheel drive will give the mower more grip and control
  
Issues:

Hardware:
1.	I am finding it difficult to figure out how to make the mower 4 wheel drive 
2.	Finding resources online on the parts required for the lawn mower to run on python 
3.	content MUST be informative, and contain substance. Information like “chassis does not work” does not provide any useful information. Instead, information content will be something like: “Chassis lacks of bracing… too much friction on the axles so the chassis is sacking in the middle…”

Software:

Solutions

Hardware:
-	Getting a v shape tire create more traction for the mower to go uphill
-	Making the lawn mower a four-wheel drive will give the mower more grip and control

Software:
-	Use Arduino as the brain of the lawn mower
